"""One onboarding, one row, and the environment both children are then handed.

Two tools used to mean two wizards and two env files; then it meant one flow writing each
child's own `SiteConfig` through that child's model. Neither child has a config model any
more — they read `OPENOUTFIND_*` / `OUTSEND_*` fresh on every run and remember nothing —
so what is left is the simplest shape yet: **ask a person once, keep the answers here,
export them into the environment before either child runs.**

**This dissolves the old objection rather than ignoring it.** The case against shelling out
to the children was that it needed "a translation layer restating both config surfaces as
env-var strings, and it drifts silently". The drift was possible because each child had a
*second* surface — a model with its own fields and validators — for the strings to drift
against. With the environment as a child's only surface, exporting it is not a translation
of anything: it is writing the one interface the child has, and a child whose variable
stops arriving says so by name on its next run.

**The wizard asks only what is missing, and never twice.** Every question is skipped when
the row already answers it or the environment already carries it, so a re-run is a no-op
and an operator who exported their own variables is not asked to repeat them into a
prompt.

**Everything is asked on stderr, the caret included.** `input`'s own prompt argument writes
to stdout, which on this program carries the CSV.
