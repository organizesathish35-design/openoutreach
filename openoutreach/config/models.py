# openoutreach/config/models.py
"""Every answer this install gave, in one row — and the two vocabularies it exports into.

**This is the one place a human's answer is remembered, and this is the program with a
human in front of it.** The children are agent-first: `openoutfind` and `openoutsend` read
their configuration from `OPENOUTFIND_*` / `OUTSEND_*` on every run and persist none of
it, because an agent supplies its environment on every invocation and has nothing to
remember. Somebody who types does not want to retype, so the wizard asks once and this row
answers for them from then on.

**Exporting is not a translation layer.** That objection was real while each child *also*
had a config model — two surfaces for the strings to drift against. With the environment as
a child's only surface, `export()` writes the one interface each child has, and the child
fails loudly naming a variable if this row ever stops filling it.

The split against the children is the same rule they follow internally: **an answer
somebody gave lives here; what a pipeline produced or measured lives in the child's own
store.** So the leads, the walk, the mail log, the suppression list and the mailbox's
learned capacity are not here and never will be.
